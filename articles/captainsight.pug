  h2 Challenge

  p We were given 48h to create a smartwatch application which would change the glasses wearers everyday life. I teamed up with two developers and one business analyst. We worked side by side for two days, day and night, to create a #[strong family game to help train sight] on a weekly basis.

  h3 Research

  p One of our team members pitched a crazy idea: play a game by #[strong using a smartwatch to interact with a screen] (phone, tablet…). For a hackathon, it would be quite an achievement… But what kind of game would be optimal for this context?

  p.strong Interviews

  p We interviewed the #[strong mentors from the sponsor team]. We found out that the jury (as well as the mentors) were around 40-60 years old parent of young kids (mostly around 10 years old). We also found out that exercising sight on a daily basis could have a positive impact on the long term. We decided to create a family game to improve sight on a daily basis which would fit the criteria and would have an emotional impact on the jury.

  p.strong Target

  p Our target is families with kids between 5 and 12 years old who possess a smartwatch and a smartphone or tablet. We looked at a French study on tablet ownership and found out than 50% of families, 8% of kids under 7 years old and 19% of 7-12 years old own a tablet.

  h3 Branding

  p Our target being families we thought a super-hero global team for the game would be engaging. I created a #[strong super-hero figure for the logo] to state the atmosphere at first sight (no pun intended). I picked pink-red as primary colour because it is #[strong eye-catching] and would help the jury remember us. I also created a single background

  h3 Interactions

  p We decided that the game would be played with a smartwatch paired with an external screen (tablet or smartphone). The smartwatch would act as a #[strong controller] and the screen as a #[strong monitor].

  p Think of when you go check your vision with a professional. You are seated at a specific distance from a white and black paper with letters written on it. You have to spell the letter as their size diminish and it becomes harder and harder to read.

  p We adapted the concept of professional vision tests to our universe by replacing the letters by famous superhero figures (Batman, Superman…). The screen must be placed 4m away from the user who holds a smartwatch. On the screen, a superhero appears. The user can select the superhero he sees on the smartwatch. The more he succeeds, the harder it gets: the superhero becomes smaller or even flies by.

  h3 Interface

  p We selected a bunch of superheroes. To represent them, we found images online and cropped them one by one so we could put them on the city background. We also found a simple logo for each of them that we used for the smartwatch.

  p With illustrator, I copied funny characters (of a kid tv show one of our team members liked) to create a profile picture for the players. I also created a simple leaderboard screen.

  p I also create a simulation of other games we could create in the future to broaden the jury vision of our concept.

  h2 Prototype

  p Our prototype was fully coded and working, even submitted to the google play store. We could actually simulate a family playing the game in front of the jury. Here is a live demo of the prototype:

  h3 2nd prize & cash rush

  p We won the 2nd prize and a bonus prize called “cash rush” awarded to the team who receives the higher number of votes for its idea on the first day of pitch. We competed against more than 30 teams.
